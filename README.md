# Pytorch Implementation of CleanUNet

This repo contains official PyTorch implementation of CleanUNet: [Speech Denoising in the Waveform Domain with Self-Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07790). CleanUNet is a causal speech denoising
model on the raw waveform. It is based
on an encoder-decoder architecture combined with several
self-attention blocks to refine its bottleneck representations,
which is crucial to obtain good results. The model is optimized
through a set of losses defined over both waveform and multi-resolution spectrograms. The proposed method outperforms
the state-of-the-art models in terms of denoised speech quality
from various objective and subjective evaluation metrics. Sound demos can be found in [This blog](https://nv-adlr.github.io/projects/cleanunet/).

## Datasets

- [Microsoft DNS 2020](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2005/2005.13981.pdf) dataset. The dataset, pre-processing codes, and instruction to generate training data can be found in [this link](https://github.com/microsoft/DNS-Challenge/tree/interspeech2020/master). Assume the dataset is stored under ``./dns``. Before generating clean-noisy data pairs, modify the following parameters in their ``noisyspeech_synthesizer.cfg`` file:

```
total_hours: 500, 
snr_lower: -5, 
snr_upper: 25, 
total_snrlevels: 31
```

And also update paths as (since their original code uses Windows-style paths)

```
noise_dir: ./datasets/noise
speech_dir: ./datasets/clean
noisy_destination: ./training_set/noisy
clean_destination: ./training_set/clean
noise_destination: ./training_set/noise
log_dir: ./logs
unit_tests_log_dir: ./unittests_logs
```

Then, for conciseness and to comply with our data loading codes, modify file names (lines 198-201) in their ``noisyspeech_synthesizer_singleprocess.py`` to

```
noisyfilename = 'fileid_' + str(file_num) + '.wav'
cleanfilename = 'fileid_' + str(file_num) + '.wav'
noisefilename = 'fileid_' + str(file_num) + '.wav'
```

To generate training data, run

```
python noisyspeech_synthesizer_singleprocess.py
```

It is also recommended to rename files in the test set for conciseness:

```
cd ./dns/datasets/test_set/synthetic/no_reverb/noisy/
for NAME in $(ls ./); do arr=(${NAME//fileid_/ }); mv ${NAME} noisy_fileid_${arr[1]}; done 
```

After these steps, we assume that the structure of the dataset folder is:

```
Training sets: 
./dns/training_set/clean/fileid_{0..59999}.wav
./dns/training_set/noisy/fileid_{0..59999}.wav
./dns/training_set/noise/fileid_{0..59999}.wav

Testing sets (no-reverb):
./dns/datasets/test_set/synthetic/no_reverb/clean/clean_fileid_{0..299}.wav
./dns/datasets/test_set/synthetic/no_reverb/noisy/noisy_fileid_{0..299}.wav
```

- Other datasets are also supported; lines 49-50 of ``dataset.py`` need to be carefully changed to handle paths and file names.

## Training

The ``$EXP`` variable can be any config name in ``./configs/``, such as ``DNS-large-full`` and ``DNS-large-high``. The default experiment path is ``./exp``; it can be changed by modifying ``train_config[log[directory]]`` in the config files. ``trainset_config[root]`` needs to be set as the root path of the dataset. Then, the training code is

``python3 distributed.py -c configs/${EXP}.json``

We use 8 GPUs for training. The global batch size is 64 and we train the models for 250K iterations. Note that, this is different from the training setup in our paper i.e., 1M iterations with a batch size of 16. We find negligible difference in terms of objective and subjective evaluation, but the current setup is faster.

**Pre-trained** models for denoising are provided in ``./exp/${EXP}/checkpoint/pretrained.pkl`` (each one has size ~177Mb; use ``git lfs`` to download). Note that these models are not trained to remove reverb.

## Denoising

We perform denoising on the DNS no-reverb test dataset. The output path is ``gen_config[output_directory]``, which is ``./exp`` by default. The denoising code is

``python denoise.py -c configs/${EXP}.json --ckpt_iter ${ITERATION}``

For example, if you want to use pre-trained models to denoise, run:

``python denoise.py -c configs/DNS-large-high.json --ckpt_iter pretrained``

1 GPU is used for denoising.

## Simple Denoising without dataset

There is a script `simple_infrence.py` to denoise single or multiple files. It also does automatic fp16 conversion. You can also adjust batch size to fit your vram.

```denoise_simple.py python denoise.py -c configs/${EXP}.json --ckpt_path ${file.plk} -b 1000000 `<you file list here>````

``` python denoise_simple.py -c configs/DNS-large-high.json --ckpt_pat ./exp/DNS-large-high/checkpoint/pretrained.pkl ./test.mp4```

## Evaluation

The following evaluation code generates [PESQ](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-P.862) and [STOI](https://ceestaal.nl/code/) scores. More evaluation metrics can be found in the [SEGAN (PyTorch)](https://github.com/santi-pdp/segan_pytorch) repo.

``python python_eval.py -d dns -e ${PATH_TO_DENOISED_SPEECH} -t ${PATH_TO_TESTSET_PATH} >> eval.log``

1 GPU is used for evaluation.

## Requirements

To synthesize [Microsoft DNS 2020](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2005/2005.13981.pdf) training data, you need [these dependencies](https://github.com/microsoft/DNS-Challenge/blob/interspeech2020/master/requirements.txt). If you just want to evaluate our pre-trained models on the test data, you may jump this.

Our code is tested on 8 NVIDIA V100 GPUs. You need to install very standard dependencies: ``numpy`` and ``scipy`` for scientific computing, ``torch, torchvision, torchaudio`` for deep learning and data loading, ``pesq, pystoi`` for audio evaluation, and ``tqdm`` for visualization.
